## TimePeriod

Some code snippets (with unit tests) to help on working with DateTimes.

<br />

#### DateOfAnyNearestDay (extension)
- Gets the DateOnly of the nearest day to a given date. Requires a DayOfWeek input.

#### TimePeriod (record; could also be a struct)
- Strongly-typed for a cleaner approach to checking whether a DateTime falls within a range of DateTimes.
